- Business fit can be mapped via business processes, so the application can be good for this process but poor for a different process. Essential can pick up the mapping either via the service or the direct mapping of the application to the process. If you look at the model, a single application can have different colours/values in the capability model if you take this approach
- Business process risk is determined by the proportion of business processes that are not permitted to use the GDPR data in scope and the CIA risk of the data.

- Business fit can be mapped via business processes, so the application can be good for this process but poor for a different process. Essential can pick up the mapping either via the service or the direct mapping of the application to the process. If you look at the model, a single application can have different colours/values in the capability model if you take this approach
- Business process risk is determined by the proportion of business processes that are not permitted to use the GDPR data in scope and the CIA risk of the data.

- Business fit can be mapped via business processes, so the application can be good for this process but poor for a different process. Essential can pick up the mapping either via the service or the direct mapping of the application to the process. If you look at the model, a single application can have different colours/values in the capability model if you take this approach
- Business process risk is determined by the proportion of business processes that are not permitted to use the GDPR data in scope and the CIA risk of the data.

- Business fit can be mapped via business processes, so the application can be good for this process but poor for a different process. Essential can pick up the mapping either via the service or the direct mapping of the application to the process. If you look at the model, a single application can have different colours/values in the capability model if you take this approach
- Business process risk is determined by the proportion of business processes that are not permitted to use the GDPR data in scope and the CIA risk of the data.

- Business fit can be mapped via business processes, so the application can be good for this process but poor for a different process. Essential can pick up the mapping either via the service or the direct mapping of the application to the process. If you look at the model, a single application can have different colours/values in the capability model if you take this approach
- Business process risk is determined by the proportion of business processes that are not permitted to use the GDPR data in scope and the CIA risk of the data.
